# NeuroLearn

The brilliance of AI meets the intricacy of the human mind in NeuroLearn, crafting an unprecedented, personalized learning experience taught by your chosen role model, tailored to captivate you. 

NeuroLearn harnesses the power of AI and neurofeedback to deliver personalized learning experiences, ensuring every student stays engaged and amplify student success.

## Inspiration

Traditional online learning platforms lack personalization, don't know much about the student's skillset and knowledge graph, and fail to engage students to facilitate a comprehensive learning experience. 

We decided to change that. By leveraging AI & Neurofeedback, we curate a tailored learning experience for you and modify the lecture to make it engaging to the student. 

## What it does

We use brain waves to gauge a student's interests and highlight relevant snippets in lectures that pertain to their learning goal. If a piece of content lacks engagement, NeuroLearn leverages 11Labs to use the student's role model to captivate them and help facilitate learning. We look at brain waves to build a student's knowledge graph over time, and suggest learning material to allow student's to develop an all-round learning experience. 

## How we built it

We used 12Labs to curate tailored learning snippets in lectures that pertain to a student's knowledge graph, background, and interest.

We use the Nuerosity Headset + SDK to gather brain wave data on focus and on specific trained neural triggers like "biting your tongue" to interact with the content in a seamless way. 

We use GPT to write questions to make the experience more interactive. 

We use 11Labs to train a voice model on the student's role model to allow them to act as a personal coach. 

## Challenges we ran into
A lot. Working with hardware is challenging. Stringing toward multiple AI agents leads to a lot of latency so we worked on optimizing our chrome extension. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We got an innovative project complete with a working demo that is built in a technically scalable manner!

## What we learned
AI baby!

## What's next for NeuroLearn
Create full knowledge graphs for a student over time to improve our recommendations. Expand our platform to support other educational platforms. We also got some interest from investors and some of our teammates might be keen on doing this full time.
